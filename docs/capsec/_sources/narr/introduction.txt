Introduction to the `Agoraplex` Capability Security Toolkit
===========================================================

.. include:: blurb.rst

From `CapabilitySecurityModel`_, in the `Portland Pattern Repository's
Wiki`_

    "A security model (`CategorySecurityModel`_) in which all
    resources are referenced by "capabilities" that both designate the
    resource, and authorize access to it. The mechanism by which
    resources are created ensures that 'names' cannot easily be
    guessed and are thus 'unforgeable'. Possessing a reference to an
    object is considered a sufficient indicator of the right to act
    upon that reference. It is assumed that if you pass a reference to
    another object, you're giving them full permission to do anything
    that object is willing to do. Security is enforced by creating
    'new' objects that limit the actions (e.g. by throwing exceptions
    or returning without operation) when the caller attempts a blocked
    action. It is assumed that you can trust the `ObjectSystem`_
    environment and host computer to not intentionally violate the
    security system."

Securing Resources
------------------

:mod:`~agoraplex.capsec` secures :term:`resource` endpoints based on a
:term:`unique identifier`, a :term:`scope`, and a
:term:`principal`. The *unique identifier* designates the *resource*
being accessed. The *scope* enumerates the specific
:term:`permissions<permission>`  :term:`authorized <authorization>` by
the capability. The *principal* indicates the identity (e.g., user,
group, role) to whom authority is granted.

.. note::

   In a web application, the *unique identifier* would be a
   :term:`URI`, and the *scope* would indicate the :term:`HTTP methods
   <HTTP method>` authorized, and the attributes of the resource on
   which those methods are allowed. E.g.:

   .. code-block:: python

      from agoraplex.capsec import Capability

      ref = 'http://api.example.com/profile/123'
      scope = 'GET'
      principals = ('user123@example.com',)
      expiry = Capability.NEVER

      cap = Capability(ref, scope, principals, expiry)

   This creates a :class:`~agoraplex.capsec.Capability` object
   granting to `user123@example.com` permission to 'GET' the
   hypothetical 'profile' stored at
   `http://api.example.com/profile/123`

   (This particular example automatically generates a random
   :term:`key`, which can be retrieved as the capability's
   :attr:`~agoraplex.capsec.Capability.key` attribute.

:mod:`~agoraplex.capsec` provides mechanisms to issue, verify, and
revoke :term:`cryptographic tokens <token>` representing the authority
to perform a set of actions on a resource by a :term:`principal`. The
tuple (:term:`unique identifier`, :term:`scope`, :term:`principal`,
:term:`key`, :term:`signature`) is a :term:`capability`, which can be
serialized for transmission across process boundaries.


Object Facades
--------------

:mod:`~agoraplex.capsec` also provides extensible facilities to manage
:term:`object facades <object facade>`. It can apply a facade based on
a :term:`capability`, yielding an object whose public interface
reflects the permissions the :term:`authenticated <authentication>`
:term:`principal` currently holds.

.. note::

   Facades are not a security mechanism. They are simply a convenience
   to allow introspection, dynamic typing, etc., to accurately reflect
   the set of capabilities currently in effect.


**TODO:** token lifetime / expiry

**TODO:** graph traversal and capability creation
