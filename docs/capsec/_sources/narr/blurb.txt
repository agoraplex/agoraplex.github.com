The `Agoraplex`_ Capability Security Toolkit (:mod:`agoraplex.capsec`)
is a Python library to apply the `object-capability model`_ of
security to arbitrary resources exposed and accessed through
references across process boundaries. It is *not* designed to provide
security or encapsulation between objects in the same process (e.g.,
to isolate untrusted code). Rather, it encapsulates the creation and
validation of interprocess references.
