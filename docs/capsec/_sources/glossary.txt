   access control
     *TODO:*

   ACL
     An *access control list*. From `Wikipedia
     <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list>`__, "a list of
     permissions attached to an object." See `ACLs don't
     <http://waterken.sourceforge.net/aclsdont/>`__ for a discussion of
     the weaknesses of ACLs and comparisons with the
     :term:`capability-based security` model.

   authentication
     Establishment of the identity of a :term:`principal`.

   authorization
     Assignment of :term:`permissions <permission>`, the right to act
     on a :term:`resource`, to a :term:`principal`.

   capability
     *TODO:*

   capability-based security
     See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security>`__

   key
     Private data used to :term:`sign <signature>` and verify a
     :class:`~agoraplex.capsec.Capability`.

   object facade
     A proxy around an object, exposing a subset of the object's
     interface.

   HTTP
     The Hypertext Transport Protocol, defined in :rfc:`2616`
     ("HTTP/1.1").

   HTTP method
     One of the request methods specified in `section 5.1.1
     <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.1>`__ of
     :rfc:`2616` ("HTTP/1.1") or its extensions (e.g., :rfc:`5789`
     ("PATCH Method for HTTP")).

   permission
     The right to act on a :term:`resource`, i.e., to apply
     :term:`verbs <verb>` to it.

   principal
     An identity (e.g., user, group, role) resolvable by
     :term:`authentication`.

   resource
     Anything identifiable by a :term:`URI`. Within a `Pyramid`_ application,
     this *may* be an element in the :ref:`resource tree <pyramid:the_resource_tree>`,
     but our use of the term is general, and framework-agnostic.

   scope
     A collection of :term:`permissions <permission>` authorized by a
     :term:`capability`

   signature
     A cryptographic hash of the contents of a
     :class:`~agoraplex.capsec.Capability`.

   token
     *TODO:*

   unique identifier
     *TODO:*

   URI
     As defined in :rfc:`3986`: "A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
     is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract
     or physical :term:`resource`."

   verb
     In general, an action to be applied to a :term:`resource` (e.g.,
     a method on an object). In a web application, this is usually an
     :term:`HTTP method`.
